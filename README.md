# Captain-Cooking
In this project, we have tried to develop an interactive website for cooking enthusiasts.
This project has been implemented using languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website enables us to search and view recipes. Searching recipes has been made easy due to categorization. This website is a time saver providing recipes being added daily, there is always something new for the user to learn. In the future, we wish to add the Database features.
